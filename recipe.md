FIRST OF ALL TAKE TWO BOILERS AND POUR WATER IN ONE AND MILK IN ANOTHER 
LET IT BOIL 
AFTER THEY BOTH BOILED;
TAKE A GLASS
TAKE SOME SUGAR AND TEA POWDER INTO THE GLASS(SUGAR AMOUNT IS UPTO YOU)
NOW POUR SOME MILK INTO THE GLASS(FILL IT HALF)
(THE MORE YOU POUR THE MILK THE LIGHTER THE TEA BECOMES AND IF YOU POUR LESS MILK IT WILL BE A STRONG TEA WHICH GIVES YOU A MUCH MORE CAFFIENE KICK)
AND NOW THE FUN PART
TAKE THE BOILED WATER AND POUR IT FROM THE HIGHEST THE IMPACT OF WATER MAKES BUBBLING IN THE MILK WHICH IS DELICIOUS
(WARNING-WATCH YOUR HANDS AS IT CAN CAUSE A SEVERE BURN IF NOT POURED CORRECTLY)
NOW TAKE A SPOON AND SHAKE THE TEA WITH IT AS A RESULT THE MICRO PARTICLES OF TEA POWDER WILL FLOAT ON TOP WHICH WILL GIVE IT A NOSTALGIC LOOK;
NOW , SERVE IT YOUR FAMILY AND ENJOY THE COMPLIMENTS 
ENJOYYY!!!
ALSO USE SOME SNAKS AS IT GIVES MORE NOSTALGIC LOOK(NOT WESTERN SNAKS)
